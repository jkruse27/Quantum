    "Qubits are the units of quantum information, the equivalent of what the bits are for classical computing. When studying quantum algorithms we usually treat them as ideal entities, and completely disregard their physical implementation, but this is what we'll be talking about in this article. There are many possible implementations of qubits, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, but we are going to be focusing on superconducting qubits as they are the ones mainly used in IBM and Google devices."
